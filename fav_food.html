        <h2>🌟 My Role Model</h2>
        <p>
            My favorite role model is <span class="highlight">Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</span>.
            He was a great scientist and the 11th President of India.
        </p>
        <p>
            He is known as the <strong>"Missile Man of India"</strong> for his contribution
            to India’s space and missile programs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Kalam inspired millions of students with his humility, discipline,
            and positive thinking. His life teaches us that
            <em>hard work, honesty, and dedication</em> can lead to success.
        </p>
        <p>
            He always encouraged young people to dream big and work hard to achieve their goals.
